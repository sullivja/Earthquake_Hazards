The Cascadia Earthquake

The Cascadia story map explores several factors that would endanger human lives and infrastructure in Oregon in the event of the Large earthquake predicted to strike the northwest in the future. 

The Cascadia Earthquake Map was made so that I could easily reference the effects of the large-scale Cascadia subduction zone earthquake to my friends and relatives about the hazards and impacts of an earthquake event in the pacific northwest that is coming sooner or later and is considered 30% likely in the next 50 years. 

The goal of the site is to geovisually demonstrate some of the ramifications of the earthquake in several ways showing how the Juan de fuca plate causes the earthquake, how the large earthquake would lead to a tsunami and the cities effected by it.

The website uses the storymap template and uses it to display specific locations and geojsons to illustrate the seismic dangers facing the pacific northwest.

A majority of my time was spent securing and working the data that was present getting it from very large geodatabases and then reducing the resolution to the extent that it could reasonably load on a webpage. I used the mapbox basemap that I created for this course, also using color coding as taught in the 

Most of the data from this map is based off Dogami and city of Portland data that had to be edited to fit onto the map and display features such as bridge collapse likelihood. 
Used mapbox, leaflet and bootstrap.
